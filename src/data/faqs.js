    {id: 1, question: "What is the best routine for the gym?", answer: "The best routine for the gym is one that is flexible with your schedule and that you enjoy. Consistency and progression are key to seeing results. For body composition goals, focus on training with volume. For strength gains, focus on programs that are specific to the lifts you want to improve, such as the bench press, squat, and deadlift."},
    {id: 2, question: "What body parts to work on what days?", answer: "The specific body part split you choose doesn't matter too much as long as you work every body part throughout the week. However, if you want to optimize your training with a higher frequency, consider pairing certain muscle groups on certain workout days. Popular pairings include full body workouts, upper/lower workouts, push/pull workouts, and push/pull/legs workouts."},
    {id: 3, question: "What should a beginner do at the gym?", answer: "For beginners, it's best to seek the help of a trained professional to learn proper exercise form. If that's not possible, start with light weights and focus on practicing the fundamentals. Record yourself performing exercises and compare your form to examples of proper form. Start with a solid foundation in terms of form to avoid injuries."},
    {id: 4, question: "What is the best workout routine for beginners?", answer: "The best workout routine for beginners depends on their comfort level and goals. Generally, beginners can start with 2-4 workouts per week, focusing on learning ideal movement patterns of fundamental lifts. Full body workouts or upper/lower workouts are good options. There are several beginner workout routines available that can provide a template to start with."},
    {id: 5, question: "What is the best workout schedule to build muscle?", answer: "The best workout schedule to build muscle is one that you enjoy and can be consistent with. Aim to hit each muscle group directly or indirectly 2-3 times per week. Full body workouts, upper/lower workouts, push/pull workouts, and push/pull/legs workouts are great options. Find a schedule that allows for optimal training frequency and volume."},
    {id: 6, question: "What are the 10 best exercises?", answer: "The best exercises vary from person to person based on individual abilities and goals. However, there are important movement patterns that everyone should train. Some personal favorite exercises include the trap bar deadlift, front squat, barbell glute bridge, Bulgarian split squat, military press, pull up, barbell row, barbell bench press, farmers walk, and dip. These exercises can be modified to suit individual needs."},
    {id: 7, question: "How do I schedule my workout at the gym?", answer: "Scheduling your workout at the gym depends on your availability and preferences. Start by figuring out how many days you can consistently make it to the gym. Then, find a workout that fits within that frequency. Look for a program that allows for makeup sessions if you miss a training day. The actual days you schedule your workouts on don't matter as much as consistency and progressive overload."},
    {id: 8, question: "Can you gain 10 pounds of muscle in a month?", answer: "While it's possible to gain 10 pounds in a month, it's unlikely to be 10 pounds of pure muscle. Rapid weight gain during a lean bulking phase is possible, but early weight gain is often from glycogen replenishment and water retention. It's better to take a slower approach to muscle gain to limit fat gain during the process."},
    {id: 9, question: "How much weight should a beginner lift?", answer: "The amount of weight a beginner should lift will vary from person to person and exercise to exercise. As a general guideline, aim to finish each set feeling as though you could've performed 1-3 more reps if pushed to your limit. Start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become more comfortable and confident with proper form."},
    {id: 10, question: "How much cardio should a beginner do?", answer: "The amount of cardio a beginner should do depends on their overall goal. For general health purposes, light cardio like walking can be beneficial. For fat loss, focus primarily on diet and add cardio as needed to increase progress. Cardio is not necessary for body composition goals, and too much cardio can hinder progress in the gym."}
